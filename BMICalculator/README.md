# Description

The "Athlete" Java class represents an athlete with attributes for name, weight, and height. It includes constructors for initializing the object with default values or specified values. Accessor and mutator methods are provided for each attribute to retrieve and modify their values. Additionally, there's a method to calculate the athlete's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight, with appropriate error handling for invalid inputs. The "TestAthlete" class serves as a test driver, demonstrating the functionality of the "Athlete" class. It creates instances of the "Athlete" class, both with default values and user-input values, and calculates their BMI accordingly. User input is facilitated using the Scanner class to input the athlete's name, height, and weight. Finally, the test driver prints out the athlete's details and BMI for verification.
